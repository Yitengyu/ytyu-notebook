## TypeScript

### Definition

> TypeScript is a typed superset of JavaScript that compiles to plain JavaScript.

1. **superset**: Existing JavaScript programs are also valid TypeScript programs. Type annotations are optional.
2. **typed**: You can set *type annotaions* for functions or variables as contract.



### The good

#### TypeScript VS Other JavaScript targeting languages

TypeScript is superset of JavaScript.



#### TypeScript VS JavaScript

Benefits are brought by type system.

- Types increase your agility when doing refactoring. *It's better for the compiler to catch errors than to have things fail at runtime*.
- Types are one of the best forms of documentation you can have. *The function signature is a theorem and the function body is the proof*.



### The bad

#### not easy to go back to JavaScript ?

#### ecosystem not friendly when use third-party module ?
