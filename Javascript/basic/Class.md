## Class

> JavaScript classes, introduced in ECMAScript 2015, are primarily **syntactical sugar** over JavaScript's existing prototype-based inheritance. The class syntax **does not** introduce a new object-oriented inheritance model to JavaScript.

So, a class written in 'Class format' can be transformed to 'prototype format',  like what Babel does， and vice versa.
